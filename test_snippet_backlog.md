# Test Snippet Integration Backlog

## Overview
This document tracks test files that need attention regarding the integration of the standard test snippet. The snippet provides common test setup functionality including logging, environment variables, and project root detection.

## Files Requiring Attention

### Diagnostic Test Files
These files have their own specific setup requirements and need careful consideration before integrating the standard snippet.

1. `tests-dest/api/test_controller_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Has custom setup for comparing different testing approaches
   - Issue: Adding standard snippet would create invalid Python syntax
   - Action Needed: Review and potentially merge logging and import functionality

2. `tests-dest/api/test_dashboard_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Custom setup for diagnostic testing
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Evaluate compatibility with standard snippet

3. `tests-dest/api/test_dependency_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Specialized setup for dependency testing
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Review and merge compatible functionality

4. `tests-dest/api/test_dependency_edge_cases.py`
   - Current Status: Custom setup for edge case testing
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Evaluate integration approach

5. `tests-dest/api/test_dependency_unwrap.py`
   - Current Status: Specialized setup for dependency unwrapping
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Review and merge compatible functionality

6. `tests-dest/api/test_error_handling_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Custom setup for error handling tests
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Evaluate integration approach

7. `tests-dest/api/test_helpers.py`
   - Current Status: Contains helper functions for testing
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Review and merge compatible functionality

8. `tests-dest/api/test_monitor_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Custom setup for monitoring tests
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Evaluate integration approach

9. `tests-dest/api/test_patch_diagnostic.py`
   - Current Status: Specialized setup for patch testing
   - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
   - Action Needed: Review and merge compatible functionality

10. `tests-dest/api/test_recommended_approach.py`
    - Current Status: Custom setup for approach comparison
    - Issue: Syntax conflict with standard snippet
    - Action Needed: Evaluate integration approach

## Integration Strategy Options

### Option 1: Preserve Custom Setup
- Keep existing setup/teardown functions
- Add only compatible parts of standard snippet (imports, logging)
- Maintain specialized test environment

### Option 2: Merge Functionality
- Combine standard snippet with custom setup
- Ensure no conflicts in environment variables
- Preserve specialized test requirements

## Next Steps

1. Review each file's specific requirements
2. Document any dependencies on current setup
3. Create test cases to verify functionality after integration
4. Implement changes one file at a time
5. Verify test results after each change

## Notes
- All files have been backed up with `.bak` extension
- Current setup in these files may be critical for their specific test purposes
- Careful testing required after any modifications
- Consider creating a test suite to verify diagnostic functionality
