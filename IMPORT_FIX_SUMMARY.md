# Mini Meta Harness Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed two main issues:

1. The API error responses were using "error_code" but some tests were checking for "error"
2. The integration tests were failing due to Python import path issues

## Solution 1: Error Field Name Fix

### Problem
The API error responses use "error_code" as the field name, but some tests were checking for "error":

```json
// API Response
{
  "success": false,
  "error_code": "not_found",  // Tests were looking for "error" here
  "message": "Resource not found",
  "details": { ... }
}
```

### Solution
We updated tests to check for "error_code" instead of "error". We did this by:

1. Examining the error response format in `utils/error_utils.py` 
2. Confirming that `error_code` is the correct field name
3. Updating tests to check for this field name

## Solution 2: Python Import Path Issues

### Problem
Integration tests were failing because they couldn't import modules from the project. This caused errors like:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'services.state_manager'
```

### Solution
We created a robust import helper system:

1. Created `tests-dest/import_helper.py` that properly sets up Python import paths
2. Added documentation in `tests-dest/README.md` explaining how to use it
3. Created a fix script to update failing tests

### How to Use the Import Helper

Add these lines at the top of any test file:

```python
from tests-dest.import_helper import fix_imports
fix_imports()
```

These lines need to be added before any other imports in the test file. The import helper:

- Identifies the project root
- Sets up Python path correctly
- Cleans module cache
- Configures environment variables

### Import Helper Implementation Details

The import helper provides:

1. **Path resolution**: Finds project root and adds it to `sys.path`
2. **Module cleaning**: Removes stale imports from `sys.modules`
3. **Clean state**: Provides a fresh `StateManager` instance for tests
4. **Verification**: Verifies that critical modules can be imported

## Test Fixing Tool

We also created `fix_integration_test.py`, a tool that:

1. Finds failing integration tests
2. Adds the import helper to them
3. Updates "error" checks to "error_code"
4. Runs the fixed test to verify it works

## Verification

We verified our fixes by:

1. Creating isolated diagnostic tests to reproduce and understand the issues
2. Running tests directly to confirm imports now work
3. Checking that error responses have the correct format

## Future Maintenance

For future maintenance:

1. Always add the import helper to new tests
2. Use the `error_code` field name in all error checks
3. Run the import helper script directly if you encounter import issues
