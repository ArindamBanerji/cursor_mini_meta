# Rules for Working with the Mini Meta Harness Codebase

## General Guidelines
- Follow instructions precisely
- Make minimal, targeted changes
- Analyze code thoroughly before making changes
- Get approval before making significant modifications

## Handling Complex Problems
- Use diagnostic tests to isolate and understand issues
- Create experimental approaches in test files first
- Validate solutions with tests before applying to production code
- Document findings and approaches in test files

## Import Issues
- When fixing import problems, create diagnostic tests first
- Test imports in isolation before changing production code
- Use a test-driven approach to verify solutions work as expected
- Document all import patterns that work in test files

## Code Modifications
- Make one change at a time
- Test each change before proceeding to the next
- Minimize changes to overall architecture
- Preserve existing patterns and conventions

## Testing
- Run relevant tests after each change
- Create specific test cases for regressions
- Document test outcomes
- Fix failing tests before proceeding

## Troubleshooting
- Use diagnostic logging in test environments
- Isolate components for testing
- Create minimal reproducible examples
- Document root causes in comments
