2. tests-dest/api/test_p2p_requisition_ui.py
3. tests-dest/integration/test_p2p_material_integration.py
4. tests-dest/integration/test_p2p_workflow.py
5. tests-dest/unit/test_session_middleware.py ✅ - Fixed and passing
6. tests-dest/unit/test_session_middleware_diagnostic.py ✅ - Created and passing
7. tests-dest/api/test_session_integration.py ❌ - Waiting on controller implementation

## Session Middleware Status:
- The session middleware implementation has been fixed and is now working correctly.
- All unit tests for the session middleware are passing (9 tests across 2 files).
- The integration tests are still failing due to missing controller implementations and template integration.
- A detailed implementation plan has been created in `test_results_summary.md`.

## Next Steps:
1. Implement exception classes needed by controllers
2. Update controllers to integrate with the session middleware
3. Create templates with flash message and form data preservation support
4. Re-run integration tests

All test files called for in v1-7-plan-v2.md have now been created.
