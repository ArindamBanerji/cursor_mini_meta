# Fix for datetime NameError in monitor_health.py

## Problem
The refactored file `monitor_health.py` (see above)  has a method `_get_iso_timestamp` in the `MonitorHealth` class that's causing a `NameError: name 'datetime' is not defined` error.

## Change Required

1. In the above re-factored file: 

2. Find the `_get_iso_timestamp` method in the `MonitorHealth` class that looks like this:
   ```python
   def _get_iso_timestamp(self):
       """Return the current time as an ISO 8601 timestamp"""
       return datetime.now().isoformat()
   ```

3. Replace it with this implementation that uses the imported `get_iso_timestamp` function:
   ```python
   def _get_iso_timestamp(self):
       """Return the current time as an ISO 8601 timestamp"""
       return get_iso_timestamp()
   ```

4. Make sure the file has the proper import at the top:
   ```python
   from monitor_health_helpers import get_iso_timestamp
   ```

## Expected Result
This change will fix the `datetime` name error by using the properly imported `get_iso_timestamp` function instead of trying to use `datetime` directly.

Output the "complete" & updated monoitor_health.py file as a separate, downloadable python file.

## Verification
After making this change - please run checks for code correctnss.
