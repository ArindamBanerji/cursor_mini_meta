# Test Code Compliance Execution Plan

## Code Compliance Rules

All tests must adhere to the following rules:

1. **No mockups or fallback routines within test code**
   - Integration tests should use real service instances
   - Unit tests should use test doubles only when absolutely necessary
   - No fallback implementations that hide import failures

2. **Test code should always use tests_dest/test_helpers/service_imports.py**
   - Direct imports from source modules are prohibited
   - All dependencies should be imported through the centralized service_imports.py
   - No duplicate import paths or redundant import statements

3. **Import failures should not be hidden**
   - Import errors should be visible and not suppressed
   - Tests should fail clearly when dependencies cannot be imported
   - No try/except blocks that silently handle import errors

4. **Do not break encapsulation**
   - No accessing private members (attributes or methods with leading underscore)
   - Use public interfaces and APIs for all interactions with services
   - Test helper methods should not use underscore prefixes unless truly private

5. **Changes to mainline sources should be preceded by analyses and diagnostics**
   - Create diagnostic tests before modifying source code
   - Document findings before making changes
   - Validate solutions with tests before applying to production code

## Detailed Implementation for Key Steps

### Step 1: Create Diagnostic Test for service_imports Completeness

Create a new test file at `tests_dest/diagnostics/test_service_imports_completeness.py` that:

1. Attempts to import all key classes and functions from service_imports.py
2. Verifies they are the correct types/classes
3. Checks for any missing essential components

### Step 2: Document Correct Import Patterns

Create `.notes/correct_import_patterns.md` with:

1. Example import statements for different categories (services, models, controllers)
2. Guidelines for import organization
3. How to handle circular imports
4. Examples of incorrect patterns to avoid

### Step 3: Verify service_imports.py Completeness

If the diagnostic test reveals missing exports, update service_imports.py to include:
1. Any missing model types or enums
2. All controller helper functions
3. Any utility functions needed by tests

### Step 4: Fix Integration Test Files

For each test file, apply a consistent approach:
1. Update imports to use service_imports.py
2. Replace mocks with real service instances
3. Fix encapsulation issues by using public APIs
4. Run tests to verify changes work

## Critical Path First Approach

This plan prioritizes the most critical issues first:
1. Ensuring service_imports.py completeness (Steps 1-3)
2. Fixing the most commonly used integration test files (Steps 4-9)
3. Addressing encapsulation issues (Steps 9-12)
4. Ensuring API tests work correctly (Steps 17-22)

Each major set of changes is validated by running tests to ensure no regressions are introduced.
