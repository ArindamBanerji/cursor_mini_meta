# SAP Test Harness Codebase Architecture

## Overview

The SAP Test Harness is a FastAPI-based application with a sophisticated testing infrastructure. The codebase is organized into distinct layers with clear separation of concerns, implementing a service-oriented architecture for material management, procurement, and system monitoring.

## Layered Architecture

The codebase follows a well-defined layered architecture pattern with the following key layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer
The topmost layer that interacts with external clients, divided into UI controllers (web interface) and API controllers (for programmatic access). This layer is responsible for request handling, input validation, and response formatting. It depends on the Service layer but has no knowledge of the persistence mechanisms.

### 2. Service Layer
The business logic layer that orchestrates operations, enforces business rules, and coordinates between different components. Services are stateless except for their dependencies on the state manager, allowing for easier testing and modularity. Each service is focused on a specific domain area (materials, procurement, monitoring).

### 3. Data Layer
The persistence layer that handles data storage, retrieval, and basic validation. This layer is implemented within the Models module, with each domain having its own data layer implementation that interacts with the state manager.

### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns
Functionality that spans across all layers, including:
- Error handling
- Logging
- Configuration
- Monitoring
- Health checks
- State management

### 5. Testing Layer
A parallel infrastructure that allows comprehensive testing of all other layers, with specialized components for mocking, test environment setup, and test isolation.

## Communication Between Layers

The application implements a clean layering approach where:

1. **Controllers** depend on **Services** but not on **Data Layers**
2. **Services** depend on their own **Data Layers** and may depend on other **Services**
3. **Data Layers** depend only on the **State Manager** and their own models
4. **Cross-Cutting** concerns like error handling and monitoring integrate at appropriate levels

The primary communication patterns are:

### Controller → Service
Controllers call service methods, passing validated request data and receiving domain objects or error responses. The dependency injection mechanism in FastAPI is used to obtain service instances.

### Service → Service
Services may call methods on other services when needed (e.g., P2PService calls MaterialService to validate materials). Services are obtained through factory functions to avoid circular dependencies.

### Service → Data Layer
Services use their respective data layers to perform CRUD operations on domain objects. Data layers abstract the persistence mechanism from the service logic.

### Cross-Layer Monitoring
The monitoring service receives information from all layers:
- Component status updates
- Error logs from exception handling
- Performance metrics from service operations
- Health check data from various components

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Service Pattern
- Hierarchical service initialization
- State management through StateManager
- Service registry for discovery and access
- Health monitoring integration
- Dependency injection for service composition

### 2. Route Management
- Declarative route definitions
- Dynamic controller loading
- Path parameter extraction
- Response type handling

### 3. Data Layer Pattern
- Data models define schemas and validation
- Data layers encapsulate persistence operations
- Service layers add business logic above data layers
- Clear separation between persistence and business logic

### 4. Error Handling
- Exception hierarchy
- Global error handlers
- Error response formatting
- Error logging and monitoring

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Fixture inheritance
- Mock object management
- Test isolation
- Path resolution system
- Mock service injection for testing

## Configuration Management

### 1. Application Configuration
- Environment-based settings
- Service configuration
- Route definitions
- Error handling setup

### 2. Test Configuration
- test_structure.json for directory structure
- Module mappings for import resolution
- Environment variables for path management
- Conftest templates for different test types

## Business Domain Models

### 1. Material Management
- Materials with properties, status, and unique identifiers
- Status transitions (Active, Deprecated, Draft)
- Validation rules for material creation and updates

### 2. Procure-to-Pay (P2P)
- Requisitions: Internal requests for materials
- Orders: Purchase orders sent to vendors
- Status workflows: Draft → Submitted → Approved → Completed
- Items with quantities, prices, and material references

### 3. Monitoring and Metrics
- Component status tracking
- Error logging with type and component classification
- System metrics collection and analysis
- Health checks with status levels (Healthy, Warning, Error)
