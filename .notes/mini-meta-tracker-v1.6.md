   - Metrics collection for CPU, memory, and disk usage
   - Error logging with context information
   - Metrics history and summary statistics
   - Component status monitoring

2. **Material Controller**:
   - Complete UI endpoints for material management
   - Material list view with search and filtering
   - Material detail view with related information

   - Cross-service monitoring capabilities
   - Enhanced service factory with monitor service support

The implementation follows the established architectural principles with clear separation between:
- UI controllers for user interaction
- API controllers for programmatic access
- Services for business logic
- Data models and persistence layers

## Refactoring in v1.6

Several important improvements were made in v1.6:

1. **System Monitoring Architecture**:
   - Created data structures for system metrics and error logs
   - Implemented component status tracking
   - Added health check logic with comprehensive system status

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**:
   - Integrated monitoring into the error handling flow
   - Improved error context information
   - Enhanced error formatting for API responses

3. **Controller Implementation Pattern**:
   - Established clear separation between UI and API endpoints
   - Created consistent error handling in controllers
   - Added thorough input validation and error reporting

4. **Main Application Enhancement**:
   - Updated main application to initialize monitor service
   - Improved service registration and initialization process
   - Enhanced startup and shutdown procedures

## Test Enhancement in v1.6

The test suite was significantly expanded in v1.6:

1. **New Test Modules**:
   - `tests/test_monitor_service.py` - Tests for monitor service capabilities
   - `tests/test_material_controller.py` - Tests for material controller UI and API endpoints
   - `tests/test_monitor_service_integration.py` - Tests for monitor integration with other services
   - `tests/test_monitor_controller.py` - Tests for monitor controller endpoints

2. **Enhanced Existing Tests**:
   - `tests/test_integration.py` - Added tests for material templates and monitoring
   - `tests/test_error_integration.py` - Added tests for monitor service error handling
   - `tests/test_service_factory_integration.py` - Added tests for monitor service factory functions
   - `tests/test_service_integration.py` - Added tests for monitor integration with other services

## Next Steps for v1.7

Based on current progress, the recommended next steps are:

1. **P2P Controller** (Feature #22, Step #21)
   - Create `controllers/p2p_controller.py` for procurement UI and API
   - Implement requisition and order management endpoints
   - Add templates for procurement views
   - Create tests for controller methods

2. **Session Middleware** (Feature #24, Step #23)
   - Implement session handling with flash messages
   - Add form re-fill on validation errors
   - Create comprehensive tests for session functionality

These additions will continue expanding the application's capabilities while maintaining the established architectural principles.

## Notes

- All v1.6 changes follow the architectural principles in `sap-architecture-coding-rules.md`
- The application can now provide both UI and API access to material data
- System monitoring provides insights into application health and performance
- Test coverage has been expanded to cover new components
- The mini-meta architecture has successfully evolved into a functional application framework
