# Fix for Import Error in services/__init__.py

## Problem
The test is now failing with a different error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_monitor_service' from 'services' (C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\__init__.py)
```

This indicates that the `get_monitor_service` function is not properly exposed in the `services` package's `__init__.py` file.

## Change Required

1. Locate and edit the services `__init__.py` file at:
   ```
   C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\__init__.py
   ```

2. Add the following import statement to expose the `get_monitor_service` function:
   ```python
   from .monitor_service import get_monitor_service
   ```

3. If the file doesn't exist or is empty, create it with the following content:
   ```python
   # services/__init__.py
   """
   Services package initialization.
   Exposes service factory functions for dependency injection.
   """
   
   from .monitor_service import get_monitor_service
   
   # Add other service imports as needed
   # from .material_service import get_material_service
   ```

## Expected Result
This change will make the `get_monitor_service` function available when importing from the `services` package, resolving the import error.

## Verification
After making this change, run the test again to verify that the import error is resolved:
```
python -m pytest monitoring/test_monitor_controller.py::TestMonitorController::test_health_check_endpoint -v
```

## Additional Diagnostic Steps
If the import error persists or new errors appear, check the following:

1. Verify that `monitor_service.py` exists and contains a `get_monitor_service` function:
   ```
   type C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\monitor_service.py | findstr "get_monitor_service"
   ```

2. Check if there are multiple Python paths being used that might be causing conflicts:
   ```python
   import sys
   print(sys.path)
   ```

3. Verify that the `services` directory is in the Python path:
   ```python
   import sys
   print([p for p in sys.path if 'mini_meta_harness' in p])
   ```
