# Test Fixes Execution Plan

This execution plan outlines the steps needed to make the test files compliant with various code rules.

## Progress Table

| Step | Action | File to Modify | Description | Success Criteria | Dependencies | Status |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Test diagnostic | tests_dest/integration/test_p2p_imports_diagnostic.py | Create diagnostic test | Tests pass with pytest | None | ✓ DONE - Tests created and passing |
| 2 | Service imports | tests_dest/test_helpers/service_imports.py | Create imports helper | File exists with imports | None | ✓ DONE - Created with all required imports from services |
| 3 | Fix test imports | tests_dest/integration/services/test_monitor_service_integration.py | Replace direct imports with service_imports | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Direct imports replaced with imports from service_imports.py |
| 4 | Test fixed file | tests_dest/integration/services/test_monitor_service_integration.py | Run test to verify fix | Tests pass with pytest | Step 3 | ✓ DONE - All tests passing |
| 5 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify no regressions | All tests pass | Step 4 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests passing |
| 6 | Fix test imports | tests_dest/integration/services/test_service_registry.py | Replace direct imports with service_imports | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Imports fixed, MagicMock instances preserved, tests passing |
| 7 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify no regressions | All tests pass | Step 6 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests still passing |
| 8 | Fix test file | tests_dest/integration/test_monitor_service_integration.py | Replace direct imports and mock instances | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - All tests passing after fixing the imports and mock instances | 
| 9 | Fix test file | tests_dest/integration/test_material_p2p_integration.py | Replace direct imports and fix underscore prefix methods | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Imports fixed and tests updated to work with service implementation |
| 10 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify fixed test files | All tests pass | Step 9 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests passing |
| 11 | Fix test file | tests_dest/integration/test_p2p_material_integration.py | Replace direct imports and rename underscore prefix methods | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Renamed underscore methods with proper names and fixed imports |
| 12 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify fixed test file | All tests pass | Step 11 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests passing |
| 13 | Fix test file | tests_dest/integration/test_integration.py | Replace AsyncMock usage with real request objects | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Replaced AsyncMock with real request objects |
| 14 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify fixed test file | All tests pass | Step 13 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests still passing |
| 15 | Fix test file | tests_dest/integration/test_service_factory_integration.py | Replace direct imports with imports from service_imports.py | Tests pass with pytest | Step 2 | ✓ DONE - Replaced direct imports with imports from service_imports.py, all tests passing |
| 16 | Run integration tests | tests_dest/integration | Verify fixed test file | All tests pass | Step 15 | ✓ DONE - All 94 integration tests still passing |
| 17 | Fix API test file | tests_dest/api/test_monitor_diagnostic.py | Fix syntax errors in import statements | Tests pass with pytest | None | ✓ DONE - Fixed syntax errors in imports, all tests passing |
| 18 | Final verification | All test files | Run all tests | All tests pass | Steps 1-17 | ✓ DONE - All integration tests and API tests are passing |

## Current Status

- Fixed `test_monitor_service_integration.py` by replacing direct imports with imports from service_imports.py
- Fixed `test_service_registry.py` by replacing direct imports with imports from service_imports.py
- Fixed `test_material_p2p_integration.py` with updated imports and test methods
- Fixed `test_p2p_material_integration.py` by renaming underscore methods and using service_imports.py
- Fixed `test_integration.py` by replacing AsyncMock with real request objects
- Fixed `test_service_factory_integration.py` by replacing direct imports with imports from service_imports.py
- Fixed syntax errors in `test_monitor_diagnostic.py` 
- All tests for the fixed files are passing

## Next Step

- The test code compliance update is complete. All integration tests and the fixed API test are now passing.
