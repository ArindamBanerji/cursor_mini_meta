# Fix for Missing get_monitor_service Function

## Problem
The test is now failing with a different error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_monitor_service' from 'services.monitor_service' (C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\monitor_service.py)
```

This indicates that the `get_monitor_service` function is not defined in the `monitor_service.py` file.

## Diagnostic Steps

1. First, check the content of the `monitor_service.py` file to see what's currently defined:
   ```
   type C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\monitor_service.py
   ```

2. Look for any function that might be serving as a service factory but with a different name.

## Change Required

1. Edit the `monitor_service.py` file at:
   ```
   C:\Users\baner\CopyFolder\IOT_thoughts\python-projects\kaggle_experiments\cursor_projects\mini_meta_harness\services\monitor_service.py
   ```

2. Add or modify the `get_monitor_service` function. A typical implementation would be:
   ```python
   # Singleton instance
   _monitor_service = None

   def get_monitor_service():
       """
       Factory function to get or create the monitor service instance.
       Uses the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists.
       """
       global _monitor_service
       if _monitor_service is None:
           from .monitor_health import MonitorHealth
           from .monitor_core import MonitorCore
           
           # Create dependencies
           monitor_core = MonitorCore()
           
           # Create the service with its dependencies
           _monitor_service = MonitorService(
               health=MonitorHealth(monitor_core=monitor_core),
               core=monitor_core
           )
       return _monitor_service
   ```

3. Make sure the `MonitorService` class is properly defined in the file. If it's not, you'll need to add it:
   ```python
   class MonitorService:
       """Service for system monitoring and health checks"""
       
       def __init__(self, health, core):
           """
           Initialize the monitor service
           
           Args:
               health: MonitorHealth instance for health checks
               core: MonitorCore instance for core monitoring functionality
           """
           self.health = health
           self.core = core
       
       def check_system_health(self):
           """Perform a system health check"""
           return self.health.check_system_health()
       
       def get_metrics(self):
           """Get system metrics"""
           return self.core.get_metrics()
       
       def get_errors(self):
           """Get system error logs"""
           return self.core.get_errors()
       
       def collect_metrics(self):
           """Collect and store current system metrics"""
           return self.core.collect_metrics()
   ```

## Expected Result
This change will properly define the `get_monitor_service` function in the `monitor_service.py` file, resolving the import error.

## Verification
After making this change, run the test again to verify that the import error is resolved:
```
python -m pytest monitoring/test_monitor_controller.py::TestMonitorController::test_health_check_endpoint -v
```

## Additional Notes
- The exact implementation of `get_monitor_service` and `MonitorService` may need to be adjusted based on the existing code structure and dependencies.
- If there are other service factory functions missing (like `get_material_service`), you may need to implement those as well.
- Check for any circular import dependencies that might be causing issues.
